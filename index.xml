      <description>&lt;p&gt;The episode begins with &lt;a href=&#34;http://adventuretime.wikia.com/wiki/Doctor_Princess&#34;&gt;Doctor Princess&lt;/a&gt; examining Finn&amp;rsquo;s flower arm, which is seen dull and has wilted some petals. He said that he had been drinking pickle juice a lot, but Doctor Princess told him to switch back to water. After this, she asks him how is he feeling, to which he replies he doesn&amp;rsquo;t feel anything and slumps out of the bed. Doctor Princess tells that that&amp;rsquo;s the reason and also that because his dad took his arm, his flower is starting to wilt and he is falling into depression. She tells him to have fun for the flower to continue its good growth, and Finn tells that she should come with him to &lt;a href=&#34;http://adventuretime.wikia.com/wiki/Crab_Princess&#34;&gt;Crab Princess&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo; party, to which she confusedly asks as a date. Finn replies yes, but she denies him, telling she doesn&amp;rsquo;t date her patients. Finn then walks out of the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scene changes to a forest in which Finn was passing while slumping his body. While he was walking, he started to sing &lt;a href=&#34;http://adventuretime.wikia.com/wiki/Lost_in_the_Darkness/Love&#34;&gt;Lost in the Darkness/Love&lt;/a&gt;, and while he was singing, a bee sees his flower and is attracted to it. The bee follows Finn to the party, where it is shown many princesses have arrived. Princess Bubblegum hosts as the DJ and all the others at the party start to dance while Finn sits on a near log with &lt;a href=&#34;http://adventuretime.wikia.com/wiki/Raggedy_Princess&#34;&gt;Raggedy Princess&lt;/a&gt;. She asks Finn to help her pour juice from her cup into her mouth, as she couldn&amp;rsquo;t do it. Finn didn&amp;rsquo;t answer back as the bee annoys him by buzzing near his face. She tells him she can&amp;rsquo;t drink it, and asks his help. Finn is getting annoyed by the bee, as it constantly gets near to him and buzzes near his face. He tells the bee to cut it out, to which the bee apologizes, and says that she didn&amp;rsquo;t realize that the flower was attached to Finn&amp;rsquo;s arm. The bee says that the flower on Finn&amp;rsquo;s arm is the greatest miracle and she is completely attracted to it. Finn thanks her, and the bee introduces herself as &lt;a href=&#34;http://adventuretime.wikia.com/wiki/Breezy_(character)&#34;&gt;Breezy&lt;/a&gt;. Raggedy Princess somehow got the juice all over her face and went out to dance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Breezy wants the flower, so she gets very nervous. She asks Finn why he is there, to which he replies that he is there to make out with Crab Princess. Since Breezy is into the flower, she agrees to help Finn with his plans. Breezy sneaks near Crab Princess and hears that she wanted someone who could dance well. Breezy tells Finn, and he starts to dance and all princesses applaud his act. Crab Princess blushes as the scene changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is seen that Finn eventually took her home, and drops her. She thanks Finn for walking her home, and Finn finally asks Crab Princess to get a kiss. She agrees and both of them kiss. Finn then bids her goodnight, to which Crab Princess replies happily and goes back to her home. Breezy congratulates Finn on his success. She then asks him how he feels, to which he says he is good, but cannot feel anything. He concludes if he made out with lots of girls, maybe he would feel something. Breezy gets near the flower, and seeing that it is good shape. Finn appreciates her help, and tells that she is a good wingman. Breezy appreciates this, and says she will help Finn to get more make outs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scene changes to Breezy and Finn going to the &lt;a href=&#34;http://adventuretime.wikia.com/wiki/Lizard_Kingdom&#34;&gt;Lizard Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;. They spy on &lt;a href=&#34;http://adventuretime.wikia.com/wiki/Lizard_Princess&#34;&gt;Lizard Princess&lt;/a&gt; and Breezy whispers something to Finn and suddenly pushes him to go make out with her. Finn goes near Lizard Princess and takes the trumpet she was blowing. He plays good music that Lizard Princess is impressed by, and they kiss. Then everyone starts to dance as Finn plays the trumpet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scene changes to now &lt;a href=&#34;http://adventuretime.wikia.com/wiki/Muscle_Princess&#34;&gt;Muscle Princess&lt;/a&gt; dancing with Finn. Breezy tries to go near Finn&amp;rsquo;s flower, but since he is dancing and moving his arm, she doesn&amp;rsquo;t get a hold. Breezy notices that Muscle Princess is sweating, so she gives Finn a towel to help Muscle Princess wipe it off. Finn wipes it off and they then kiss each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scene changes to &lt;a href=&#34;http://adventuretime.wikia.com/wiki/Jake&#34;&gt;Jake&lt;/a&gt; skateboarding near the &lt;a href=&#34;http://adventuretime.wikia.com/wiki/Tree_Fort&#34;&gt;Tree Fort&lt;/a&gt; where there are many ladies in wait. He goes inside to see Finn with a princess. She introduces herself as &lt;a href=&#34;http://adventuretime.wikia.com/wiki/Frozen_Yogurt_Princess&#34;&gt;Frozen Yogurt Princess&lt;/a&gt;. Jake then says she is looking like somewhat a mix between &lt;a href=&#34;http://adventuretime.wikia.com/wiki/Princess_Bubblegum&#34;&gt;Princess Bubblegum&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://adventuretime.wikia.com/wiki/Flame_Princess&#34;&gt;Flame Princess&lt;/a&gt;, and so Jake teases Finn that he isn&amp;rsquo;t over with both of them. Finn gets angry and leaves with Breezy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finn tells Breezy, that he is just having fun, which is the doctor&amp;rsquo;s order. He also says but this isn&amp;rsquo;t helping him, and he should let the flower die. Breezy tells Finn that he has a responsibility to the flower. She also says she has responsibilities, as she was born as a virgin Queen Bee. She said that once she drinks the Royal Jelly, she will not be free as she is now. Finn tells her to stay free always, to which she agrees. She gets excited and suddenly she says that they should make out with each other, hinting she is attracted to him. Finn then gets confused while Breezy tries to cover up what she says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As they run by a river, she faked an accident into bumping Finn to get hold of the flower, but they both fall in the river. As Finn floats on the river with Breezy atop, a male bee sees her and tells her to get back to her hive. She refuses and tells she has a carefree life and Finn agrees. Suddenly the bee calls more of his friends to deal with Finn. Finn starts to get attacked by them and fights them back but in vain. Breezy then goes to the hive of the male bees and comes back with a bottle of Royal Jelly. She tells him to not worry and she drinks the Royal Jelly. Breezy starts to transform in more humanoid type and bigger than Finn. She can now control the male bees and throws them back to their house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Breezy then tells she has become a Queen to save Finn, and also admits that she only wanted to help because she was attracted to the flower. She confesses that after hanging out with Finn, she loves him. She then tells Finn that he can partake at her pollen crumbles and become her drone. Finn appreciates this but tells Breezy that he wants to keep their relationship simple, and so Breezy gets hurt. She flies away while crying. The scene changes to Finn being with LSP and dancing. She tells him to stop dancing and to start making out. They both kiss, and Finn starts to go. To Finn one kiss is making out, but for LSP that&amp;rsquo;s not enough. She stops Finn and they make out LSP style.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scene changes to Finn lying down. Finn then asks his flower arm if it was okay. It wilts, so he sends his memory of the &amp;ldquo;LSP make-out&amp;rdquo; into his mental vault.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many fireflies flying and suddenly, the shadow of Breezy appears. She starts to sing, which helps the flower. Finn starts to sing with her unconsciously. When Finn notices Breezy, he sees her as Princess Bubblegum, holding a sword (which would later become known as the &lt;a href=&#34;http://adventuretime.wikia.com/wiki/Finn_Sword&#34;&gt;Finn Sword&lt;/a&gt;). As soon as Breezy finishes the song, Finn&amp;rsquo;s flower arm grows into a great flowering tree and breaks. After ripping the remaining bark off, Finn sees a new arm covered in honey, with a thorn in it. Finn flicks the honey off to see that his original arm has grown back, and he starts to dance in joy. LSP wakes up to see Finn has gotten his arm back, and she was happy for him. Finn notices Breezy and his flower falling on her head. The episode ends with Breezy kissing the flower.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Tower (Season 6)</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The episode starts with Finn trying to make spaghetti with a bulky candy arm. His bulky arm doesn&amp;rsquo;t help Finn and he starts destroying things and as he continues to mess things up, he gets frustrated and his candy arm explodes. &lt;a href=&#34;http://adventuretime.wikia.com/wiki/Jake&#34;&gt;Jake&lt;/a&gt;comes down stairs, hoping for the spaghetti, but instead sees the mess and tells him that he should just take his time and listen to his &amp;ldquo;Melon Heart.&amp;rdquo; Finn then says he wants to go to space so he can take &lt;a href=&#34;http://adventuretime.wikia.com/wiki/Martin&#34;&gt;his father&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;s arm. Jake tells him not to do this but to just relax and think and that he&amp;rsquo;s going to the store to buy replacement kitchen supplies for the ones Finn broke. Finn goes outside the tree fort and he lies on the ground. He starts to talk to himself and then suddenly he notices a pile of rocks forming behind him and that there is an odd, sightly transparent arm, where his real arm used to be. He then decides to use this arm to build a tower into space to find his dad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Jake is returning home, the tower has grown considerably and &lt;a href=&#34;http://adventuretime.wikia.com/wiki/Princess_Bubblegum&#34;&gt;Princess Bubblegum&lt;/a&gt; is there and tells Jake that Finn&amp;rsquo;s got a new arm, what she believes to be a telekinetic electro-emotional prosthesis and is dangerous and could hurt him and other people around him. Jake shakes off the notion and says what Finn&amp;rsquo;s doing is healthy and he should just be left alone. As Finn continues his tower he enters the cloud house of a &lt;a href=&#34;http://adventuretime.wikia.com/wiki/Cloud_People&#34;&gt;Cloud person&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&#34;http://adventuretime.wikia.com/wiki/Carroll&#34;&gt;She&lt;/a&gt; tells Finn to leave, and when he doesn&amp;rsquo;t, blasts him with lightning with her gun. This moves the house out of the tower and the cloud person then says that Finn must be, &amp;ldquo;One of those swimmers,&amp;rdquo; and leaves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next day large chunks of Ooo&amp;rsquo;s landscape are missing because of the tower, including a rookery of &lt;a href=&#34;http://adventuretime.wikia.com/wiki/Penguins&#34;&gt;penguins&lt;/a&gt;. The cloud person from the day prior returns to Finn, introduces herself as Carroll and apologizes and asks if he&amp;rsquo;s really going to take his father&amp;rsquo;s arm. Finn states that he is and the cloud person talks about how she was water once and how swimmers would always be swimming in her, so she got evaporated and became air. She then tells Finn he should let it go, runaway, and hate his life like she has.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the ground &lt;a href=&#34;http://adventuretime.wikia.com/wiki/BMO&#34;&gt;BMO&lt;/a&gt; asks Jake what Finn is doing (not before getting crushed into the ground by a falling ice block). Jake says Finn&amp;rsquo;s just working some stuff out and that it&amp;rsquo;s completely healthy, which is directed at PB who is working on some sort of device. PB disagrees and says that Finn could get hurt. As Finn&amp;rsquo;s tower has finally reached the atmosphere, Carroll asks what it&amp;rsquo;s like up there and wonders if she should become space ice. Finn, who is extremely oxygen deprived, sees a similar looking portal to the one the &lt;a href=&#34;http://adventuretime.wikia.com/wiki/Void_Caster&#34;&gt;Void Caster&lt;/a&gt; made in &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://adventuretime.wikia.com/wiki/Escape_from_the_Citadel&#34;&gt;Escape from the Citadel&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;rdquo; but suddenly a bright light comes at him and he blacks out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finn then wakes up in what seems to be a space ship and walks to the next room to see his &amp;lsquo;father&amp;rsquo; watching TV. Finn surprises his father and punches him into unconsciousness and tries to take his arm. As Martin moans about his favorite arm, Finn changes his mind and it is revealed that Martin was really a disguised PB. She says she tricked Finn and took him to the &lt;a href=&#34;http://adventuretime.wikia.com/wiki/Candy_Kingdom&#34;&gt;Candy Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; fallout bunker, and since he had so little oxygen that he was already hallucinating, the trick was easy to pull off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finn returns home, with his telekinetic arm gone, and tells Jake that he&amp;rsquo;s calmed down. Jake says that&amp;rsquo;s great and asks if Finn wants to do the honors of taking down the tower. Finn says he would and removes a plank of wood near the base of the tower, which then collapses sideways, destroying a large portion of the Candy Kingdom, to the shock of Finn and Jake. The episode ends with Princess Bubblegum screaming, &amp;ldquo;AHHH! MY ARM!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
