<p>I am no expert by any means, but I see plenty of noise about preserving Tamil culture, fogging the real arguments for Jallikattu.</p>

<h2 id="the-origin-of-jallikattu">The origin of Jallikattu</h2>

<p>Until very recently where tractors have become common place, cattle was reared primarily as work animals. Large scale milk production and export from rural to urban area came only with the recent white revolution.</p>

<p><em>takeaway</em> : <u>Selective breeding was for the best bloodline of work animals</u></p>

<p>In the wild bulls battle each other for the privilege of procreation. Jallikattu is a mild replacement for the natural selection. The competition involves unarmed men holding on to hump of the bull for a short distance. The bull is considered a champion if the bull is spirited enough to not let anyone hold on to it.</p>

<p>The bull and its bloodline are now in great demand to breeders. Pretty much like dog breeds, but purely based on strength, agility, health and perhaps skills. So less of a Chihuahua and more German Shepard like breeding.</p>

<p><u>Stronger regulations since 2009</u></p>

<p>Requires the bull as well as the players to go through govt. appointed pre and post medical checkup and a panel to thwart any malpractice.</p>

<p><strong>Side effects</strong></p>

<p>Breeding for shelf life and appearance, results in less than appealing taste or nutrition. For anyone from Africa or SE asia, the bananas/mangoes in European supermarkets definitely seem like wannabes. The same is very true with milk production.</p>

<p>The milk from native breeds of Asia and Africa (&amp; draught breeds) is generally not competitive in quantity but is considered premium (of type A2), the health benefits are debated but considering the strong lobby of the dairy industry one could side in favor of A2.</p>

<h2 id="lack-of-human-touch">Lack of human touch</h2>

<p>The animal husbandry in much of the world is without human or humane connection, it is automated and mechanical, optimizing for nothing but profits - the rise of factory farms.</p>

<p>The has lead to several moments among the people and classification of food and animal products - Vegan, free range poultry, milk and meat. The factory farms are quickly catching up in India. It might be a hard thing to reverse.</p>

<p><strong>Demand and Status of native breeds</strong></p>

<p>Preserving Jallikattu would be a crucial step to keep bulls a part of the family, even as their commercial relevance falls otherwise. It might also be relevant to preserving these native breeds. The number of native Indian breeds have already dropped from more than a 100 to just 36 today.</p>
